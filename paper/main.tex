\section{Problem Definition}
\subsection{Outline the problem requirements and include the application domain and motivations of your project (1 page).}
\linebreak
Business and product owners want meaningful feedback from their customers to assist in their growth and success. It can be difficult to collect this information without onsite hardware and processing the data provided can be a timely task. As with many forms of customer engagement and ratings, customers can be unwilling to participate in traditional methods of feedback if too many steps are required, so the data collected will not be an accurate portrayal of opinions.
\newline


In order to solve this problem, we have created a web application that allows for customers to provide their feedback in a simplistic way, and displays this information for businesses or owners in a way that it simple to understand without the need for onsite hardware. By allowing the customer to interact with a site that is not cumbersome, and can be done from the convenience of their smart phone, many more customers will be willing to submit their thoughts and opinions.
\newline

Our web application is created specifically to benefit business owners or managers who want to monitor the opinions of their clientele in a simplistic way. Based on our previous experiences, these surveys for clientele are often annoying to complete or difficult to find. Often they require typing in a website manually from the back of a receipt which is not worth most people's time. By creating a website that consolidates everything to a simple QR code that can be scanned by a smart phone either posted at the physical location to be rated, or printed on a receipt to be done after the fact. 
\newline

By making surveys more accessible and simple to fill out, more people will be willing to participate, making survey results more accurate. As of now, most people who leave reviews or fill out surveys have extreme opinions which may sway the results in one way or another, so by creating this application, we have hopes that more people will share their opinions making the results much more well rounded.

\section{Application Benefits}
\subsection{What are the benefits of your application when compared to existing systems. Choose two systems only and include their references (2 pages).}
\linebreak
Our application is a simple tool for conducting self-administered surveys. Our users can log into their profiles to view customer feedback to improve their businesses. QR codes can be generated for wide distribution and quick access. SurveyMonkey (\url{https://www.surveymonkey.com/}) and QuestionPro (\url{https://www.questionpro.com/}) are comparable existing systems. Some benefits of our application are that the users can received unlimited number of responses for their surveys without cost and all features to create the surveys are free as well. Our application does not have many templates and complicated tools that may negatively impact loading time. Respondents do not need to create an account to respond to surveys. 

\hfill 

\subsubsection*{Survey Monkey}\hfill 

Survey Monkey is one of the more popular survey platforms as of now. It has lots of different options for different groups of people who may be interested in gaining an insight into people's opinions. With its wide array of available options, it is what many people think of when someone mentions a survey website.
\newline

Survey Monkey's website is very overwhelming to look at on first glance, but after a bit of digging you are able to find a bit of information on the packages available. In the past, they have had a pretty large amount of features for free users, but now their free package is very limited. Currently, their free package only allows for unlimited surveys, but with a restriction of 10 questions each, and only allows for a limited amount of responses. This means that if you want to get information with a large group of people, you would have to create multiples of the same surveys and compile the data together manually.
\newline

Overall, SurveyMonkey is a good tool for users who want to create surveys quickly and easily, but it may not be the best fit for people who want more expansive options for length of survey, and ability to view feedback. The limited free plan and cost may also be a reason for people to choose an alternative.

\break
\subsubsection*{QuestionPro}\hfill

QuestionPro, similar to Survey Monkey, has many different options depending on the customer and type of data they want to collect. It has many of the same options as Survey Monkey has when it comes to questions type, but seems like it's list of features might be more expansive.
\newline

QuestionPro has a very similar home page to Survey Monkey, but made it easier to find the differences between their packages available. This site has many more features available for free users than Survey Monkey, but still has a limit to the amount of questions and responses unless you pay. Rather than limiting to 10 question per survey, QuestionPro allows free users to have up to 100 questions per survey with up to 300 responses which is a very large increase in comparison to Survey Monkey.
\newline

QuestionPro is definitely a powerful tool for creating surveys online, but may be confusing for users with limited technology experiences. The cost for full access is also a restriction for some, but in comparison to Survey Monkey, the free version includes a much larger amount of features and usability.
\newline

Both of these other platforms for similar survey creation to ours lock many features behind a paywall. Our goal to create a very simple survey platform eliminates the confusion from having too many options or limited response allowances to make it more user friendly. We also only have a free option available for all users, so no features are hidden behind a paywall, allowing everyone to have the same experience while using it.

\section{Top-level and Low-level Software Design}
\subsection{Provide the MVC architecture according to the selected Web framework. Also, describe at least three benefits of MVC for your application.}
\newline
\hfill

Django uses MVT (Model View Template) architecture which is a variation of the traditional MVC (Model View Controller) architecture. Similar to the MVC, the model in MVT represents the data and business logic. The view in MVT is split into two parts: the template displays the data, and the view handles the user input and interacts with the model to retrieve and manipulate the data. Similarly to the MVC, MVT separates layers and keeps the code organized and maintainable, while also simplifying the view by separating it into two parts. 
\newline

The MVT architecture allows the developer to work on each layer in parallel and then integrate them efficiently. In our project, we used this feature to build and test the three main functions: user authentication process, creation of surveys by the feedback gatherers, and submission of surveys by the respondents. We were able to implement one functionality at a time while working on all of the layers in parallel. One member created the HTML templates while another worked on the models to store the data. Views were then set up followed by finalizing the templates to display the data. Using this method, we were able to develop our web application much faster.
\newline

The MVT architecture allows the developers to make modifications that will not affect the entire model. During development, many changes were required on the templates to enhance the user interface. It was beneficial that the changes in the HTML and CSS only affected the templates and not the entirety of the web application. Many adjustments were also made in the views as well including setting page restrictions for authentication and changing the interactions on the models for submitting data using the forms. Again, the MVT architecture made this process simpler by isolating the modifications.
\newline
\newpage
One major advantage of the Django MVT architecture is the simplified testing process. Since all layers of the application are structurally defined, we were able to test our three main functionalities as we were developing them. For example, for the creation of surveys, the clearly defined structure of the template, model, and view helped us to run tests efficiently. Using an account, we created survey and submitted them and checked the database to verify that the data from the surveys was accurately stored. The clear structure also allowed for efficient debugging and modifications because we knew which template, model, and view were responsible for which functionality.
\newline

        \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{mvt.png}
        \caption{MVT Architecture}
    \end{figure}

    \newpage
    
\subsection{Observer and Factory design patterns. Explain in detail the usability of these two patterns for your specific application. Include the complete class diagram for each pattern. Also provide the algorithms corresponding to the pattern’s important methods. For each class, provide the data types of the attributes and prototypes of the methods.}

\textbf{Observer Patterns}

Similar to the MVC architecture, the views in Django’s MVT architecture are the dependent objects while the models are the independent objects. In our application, the observer pattern can be used to manage the relationship between the views and the models by notifying the different views whenever there are changes in the model’s data. This can be useful since there are multiple views that are affected by the changes in the data. For example, when a user adds or deletes a survey, this change would be reflected in the survey model. All of the views related to this model would be notified of these changes. The user profile template would display the addition or the deletion of a survey while a new survey page template would be created or deleted. The observer model can be useful in maintaining consistency between the related objects and keeping them up to date. 
\newline
\hfill \break
\textbf{Factory Patterns}

In our application, the factory design pattern can be used to store the family of objects in one class and to keep the code of building the objects hidden from the clients. For example, a factory class can be used for the creation of surveys, which is a family of related objects. The factory class would be the centralized class that creates a family of different surveys. This results in consistent products for all clients while having a highly maintainable program with no duplication of code. The factory class would return a survey depending on the questions and the type of answers selected by the client. The factory design pattern is useful for our application because we have many users that need the same family of objects which is the survey.

\subsection{List of software tools and environments. Provide briefly their benefits specifically for your application.}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Django
   \begin{description}
     \item The main functionality of our web application requires a web framework with a database that can be used to store and load a user’s data such as their surveys and responses. Django allows quick and efficient development of our web application by providing the framework and the modules needed. The nuisance of creating and connecting to a database is already implemented in Django, so we were able to quickly test the storage and loading of our data in the early stages of development. Migration of our data was also made simple by Django because it only requires running a few commands in the terminal. 
   \end{description}
   \item[]
   \item ngrok
    \begin{description}
        Ngrok provides web application hosting services with a publicly accessible URL. It is a free tool which allows secure tunneling from a public URL to our local application. This feature of ngrok allowed us to test the display of data on the templates after the extraction and loading of data from the model layer directly on the public URL. It was helpful for all of the members to view the updates in real time on the public URL.
    \end{description}
    \item[]
   \item MySQL
   \begin{description}
       The data in the model layer of Django was migrated to the MySQL database. The MySQL database was used to store our user data because it is a reliable, free, and open-source database. Being the most popular database, it is a secure and scalable with the ability for complete customization. Any changes made to our model could be handled by the MySQL database. Also, the assurance of continuous uptime allowed us to consistently work on our application.
